# Technical requirements
- Python 3.11

# Motivation
## From https://docs.google.com/document/d/17wbCD6rqCNH-hJNP0A_-wUo9sM5KoWJbJZSaQp8A-HY/edit?tab=t.0:
**Identifying age of persons in a image, video, audio, or text**
- Under 25 is sufficiently accurate. Similarly, recognizing that someone is over 30 is great. There is no need to determine exact ages. 
- Analyze audio/text to identify when someone states their age. "I'm 23" Or to where age is asked.
